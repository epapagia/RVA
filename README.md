Reference Vector Algorithm

We provide the implementation of the Reference Vector Algorithm (RVA). 

Prerequisites: 

Go to the project of GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation on Github, https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe 

Clone the project: 
$ git clone http://github.com/stanfordnlp/glove

and then:
$ cd glove && make

Replace the existing demo.sh file in the glove project with the demo.sh file of the current project.

Run RVA.py
